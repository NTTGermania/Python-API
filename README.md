Python project using Weather and Google API

Instructions

This is the repo for the Python-API project.  First begin by accessing  python_scripts folder.  In the python_scripts folder, you can find the two main jupyter notebook files call VacationPy.jpynb and WeatherPy.jpynb, those notebooks are where I have my main codes.  I also include my observations in the WeatherPy.jpynb file.   The plot folder contains the png files I made and the google map images.
